# nohscadlib

some common and recurrent functions i need with my openscad project


- fillet.scad : to add or create round corners or progressive junctions
- round.scad: when working with polygons add a configurable number of intermediary points to ound up a corner
- support.scad: add manually supports, when printing without support but still at some points some are needed
- sweep.scad: create from a vector of cuts a solid by adding planes around the cuts
